# Tech@Nest Workshop

A C++/CMake/git exercise for the workshop held at Nest on the 07/04/2017. 
Attendees are required to clone this repository, complete a C++ program to 
compute the [variance of a uniform distribution](
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_distribution_(continuous)#Moments
) *U*(0, 1), compile it with CMake and verify it is approximately 1/12.
Finally, they have to submit their solution to this repository.
